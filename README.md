# Meet the Team!
**************************************************************************************
*Description

We are one of the  FTC robotics team of Cary Academy. We hope to acheive greatness through hard work and logical reasoning.

**Members:

*Alex Zoetmulder: 
Alex wants to create better robots in the attempt to reach further competitions. He joined the team in 2016  because he thinks robots are cool. He has limited experience with robotics but wants to get experience by joining the team. He contributes a helping hand and his skills of project management 

*Ethan Norfleet:  
Ethan Norfleet is an aspiring Software Developer. He joined the Cary Academy FLL team during the 2015 season and his leadership significantly contributed to the team's winning of the Project Solution. He felt that joining the FTC team was the obvious next step to further his robotics learning. He has experience with the Java and Python programming languages as well as Arduinos, LEGO Mindstorms, and VEX Robotics. He hopes to contribute both his skills with both hardware and software to bring the team to success. 
 
*Evan Snively: 
Evan Snively wants to colonize Mars within the next 40 years. He joined the Cary FTC team in 2016. He joined because that he thinks that robotics is fun. He brings moral support and an extra two pairs of hands. (he really wants to get to Mars) to the team. 
 
*John Kesler: 
John Kesler wants to be successful in life. He joined the team in 2016 because he enjoys roboticsh. He has experience with the Java Programming Language and has worked with LEGO Mindstorms. He hopes to contribute his knowledge of CAD and Computer Sciences. 
 
*Jono Jenkens: 
Jono Jenkens is unsure what he wants to do in the future. He was a member of the Cary Academy FLL team from 2014 to 2015 and joined the Cary Academy FTC team in 2016. He joined the team because he enjoys robotics. He wants to contribute his building skills to the team. 
 
*Loren Troan 
Loren Troan wants to get a degree in computer science and start a business. He switched to our team from the Team 12010 in 2016 because he felt that he didn't enjoy working on that team. He has been programming since 6th grade did 1 Â½ year of robotics. He hopes to contributes his ideas to the team to better focus on its goals 
 
*Matthew Modi 
Matthew Modi wants to get to States and Beyond and improve his knowledge of technology. He joined the team in 2016 so he could reach his goal of improving his knowledge of technology. He has been programming and building for four years and he hopes to contribute these skills to the team. 
 
*Sheridan Page: 
Sheridan Page is also unsure what he wants to do in the future, though he also wants to colonize Mars (and preferably sooner than 40 years). He was involved in Middle School robotics for 3 years, though he never was on an FLL team. He joined the team because he enjoys robotics and computer programming, and he likes to use power tools. As a newcomer to FTC robotics, he doesn't have the most qualifications, but he does have three years of Lego robotics experience. He also did Arduino Club during the 8th grade. He hopes to contribute his programming and building skills.
